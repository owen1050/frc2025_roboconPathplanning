This repo has 3 things:

1. An april tag JSON which can be imported instead of the 2025 welded field to update the location of the tags at robocon

2. An updated field image for path planner and advantage scope so you can see the robocon field in those programs

3. An example 2025 robot project which shows you how to update path planner lib with the smaller field and how to update your april tag json. 

If you have any questions feel free to ask in the CD thread:https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/how-to-adapt-pathplanner-to-off-season-field-dimensions/505069/6?u=owen_busler
